# Reporting for ASP.NET Core â€” Detect and Load Custom Fonts with Ease (DXFontRepository)

The following example detects and loads custom fonts used within a report. The application obtains a list of all fonts used in the report and loads them from the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) resource, when available. Loaded fonts are added to the [DXFontRepository](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/404255/devexpress-drawing-library/use-font-repository-to-add-custom-fonts) automatically and made available without additional installation requirements.
